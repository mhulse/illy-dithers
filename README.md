## Development

![](dithers.gif)

The main goal is to make sure everything is snapped to a whole pixel; in the above example, I had to adjust the pattern bounding box and the vector’s alignment to the pixel grid.

If done properly, the patterns should look exactly the same in pixel and normal preview modes.
